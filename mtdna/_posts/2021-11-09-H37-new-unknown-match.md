In the last few days a new member of our **H37** Haplogroup has tested at Family Tree DNA (FTDNA). While I haven't established contact with him, with the help of some other matches on FTDNA, I can place the new match at exactly **H37b**. This is the base of the European branch of **H37**. The new match has a surname which suggests Slovakia or the Czech Republic. 

Additionally another person has uploaded to YFull and appears under **H37b*** which means he/he is at the same level as the match above but has one or more extra private mutations. This person comes from the Zl√≠n Region of the Czech Republic. He/She may be one of the two **H37b*** matches we already have at FTDNA. 

I've also attached a new time-line graph of the H37 tree, showing the likely H37b dating. Hope you like it.
