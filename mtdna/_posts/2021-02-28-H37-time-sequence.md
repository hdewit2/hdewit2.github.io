I used a Coalescent Simulation model called GeneTree to estimate the ages of my version of the H37 tree. As part of its input you need to provide a node description of your tree, with the numbers of mutations, and the number of samples on each line. The number of samples is gathered from my own matches on FTDNA and the GenBank. It's only a rough guide, but then there is probably no really accurate system.

Here is my phylotree of H37 with my own estimated TMRCA ages.

Note the two Bulgarian samples are actually early Bronze Age (2200 BC) from the Bereketska mogila (mound) in southern Bulgaria. My dating system doesn't take this into account and assumed they were modern like the others. So the dating of the H37a branch will be upset by this. It would suggest that H37 is older than indicated.
